# Blockchain-Based Manufacturing Digital Twin

## Overview

This project implements a digital twin solution for manufacturing environments using blockchain technology. The system creates a secure, transparent, and immutable record of production facilities, equipment, operational data, simulations, and optimization strategies.

## Key Components

### Facility Verification Contract
- Validates and registers legitimate production sites
- Maintains cryptographic proof of facility credentials
- Prevents unauthorized manufacturing locations from participating in the network

### Equipment Registration Contract
- Records detailed specifications of manufacturing assets
- Tracks ownership and maintenance history
- Enables secure transfer of equipment ownership

### Operational Data Contract
- Captures real-time production metrics from IoT sensors
- Ensures data integrity through blockchain verification
- Provides immutable audit trails of manufacturing processes

### Simulation Contract
- Manages digital replicas of physical manufacturing processes
- Enables scenario testing and predictive analysis
- Synchronizes with real-world data for continuous improvement

### Optimization Contract
- Generates improved production parameters based on simulation results
- Implements machine learning algorithms to enhance efficiency
- Distributes optimized settings to participating facilities

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-manufacturing-twin.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd blockchain-manufacturing-twin

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
truffle compile

# Deploy to test network
truffle migrate --network testnet
```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file with your configuration parameters:
   ```
   NETWORK_URL=<your_blockchain_network_url>
   PRIVATE_KEY=<your_private_key>
   ```

2. Modify `config.json` to set your specific manufacturing parameters.

## Usage

### Initialize a New Facility
```javascript
const facilityContract = await FacilityVerification.deployed();
await facilityContract.registerFacility("Facility Name", "Location", "Certification ID");
```

### Register Equipment
```javascript
const equipmentContract = await EquipmentRegistration.deployed();
await equipmentContract.addEquipment("Equipment ID", "Model", "Specifications", facilityId);
```

### Log Operational Data
```javascript
const operationsContract = await OperationalData.deployed();
await operationsContract.logData(equipmentId, "temperature", temperatureValue);
```

## Security

This system implements several security measures:
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks
- Access control through role-based permissions
- Data encryption for sensitive information
